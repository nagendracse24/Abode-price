# README for Linear Regression Machine Learning Project for House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project is focused on building a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features. The primary objective is to utilize **Linear Regression** to analyze the relationship between different variables influencing house prices and to ensure reliable predictions based on historical data.

## Project Description
This machine learning project employs a dataset to predict house prices in the USA based on several factors, such as average area income, average house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and area population. Utilizing Linear Regression allows us to quantify the relationships between these features and the target variable (house price).

### Goals:
- Understand dataset structure and feature relationships.
- Build a predictive model using Linear Regression.
- Validate model performance through various evaluation metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning and model evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and presentation of the analysis.

## Data Overview
The dataset utilized in this project is named `USA_Housing.csv`, which contains 5000 records. Key features in the dataset include:

- **Avg. Area Income**: Average income in the area where the house is located.
- **Avg. Area House Age**: Average age of the houses in the area.
- **Avg. Area Number of Rooms**: Average number of rooms in houses in the area.
- **Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms**: Average number of bedrooms in houses in the area.
- **Area Population**: Total population of the area.
- **Price**: The price of the houses (target variable).
- **Address**: The address of the houses (not used in prediction).

### Data Loading and Inspection
The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, which allows for initial inspections using methods like `.head()` and `.info()` to understand data types and check for null values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis is conducted to understand relationships between features and the target variable, visualize distributions, and handle potential outliers.

### Key EDA Steps:
- **Pairplot**: Visualize pairwise relationships between features to assess correlation and distribution.
- **Distplot**: Assess the distribution of house prices.
- **Heatmap**: Understand correlations between features and the target variable.

## Model Building
### Feature Selection
The features are selected as follows:
- **Independent Variables (X)**: Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms, and Area Population.
- **Dependent Variable (y)**: Price.

### Data Splitting
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to allow the model to learn from part of the data and be evaluated on unseen data.

### Linear Regression Model
A Linear Regression model is created and trained on the training dataset. The fitted model is then used to make predictions on the testing dataset.

## Evaluation Metrics
To assess the performance of the Linear Regression model, several evaluation metrics are calculated:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures average error magnitude.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures average squared error.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of MSE, giving a sense of error magnitude in relation to the scale of the predictions.

```python
print('MAE:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions))
print('MSE:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
print('RMSE:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)))
```

## Installation Instructions

   env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Conclusion
This project provides a robust framework for predicting house prices using a Linear Regression model. There are opportunities for further improvement, such as:
- Exploring more advanced regression techniques (e.g., Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression).
- Implementing feature scaling techniques if necessary.
- Further feature engineering to enhance model performance.

By following this guide, users can gain insights into how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems such as housing price prediction, while also familiarizing themselves with key data science workflows and tools.
